# Solar System App

Just a fun Solar System info app to get some practice using NASA's open APIs. The Earth page uses the EONET API to track major geological and meteorlogical events taking place on the Planet. The Mars page using the Mars Rover Photo API as well as the Martain Weather API. The splash page uses the Astronomy Picture of the Day API. The other planet pages are filled with some basic data and brief blurb, though someday, hopefully, there will be new APIs to make each page more interesting!
